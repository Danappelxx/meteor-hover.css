## This is a wrapper for the original [hover.css](https://github.com/IanLunn/Hover) kit.


#Demo

This [demo page]() shows the animations in action.

# Usage

It's very easy to use: simply add the class of your transition to your element.
The element can be nearly anything (anchors, buttons, images (!), etc.)
